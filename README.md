# Predicting Artist Genres

Authors: Donna Lee & Jake Ash

## Overview 

Using a dataset from Spotify, we looked at genre by artists from the years 1921 to 2021. The dataset included mean attributes (listed below) of all the artist's songs and their genre tags. 

We noticed that around 58% of the artists did not have any genre tags so we wanted to create a prediction model to predict the general genre of the artist.

* Danceability
* Duration 
* Energy
* Instrumentalness
* Liveness
* Loudness
